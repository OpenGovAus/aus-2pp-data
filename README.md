# 2PP Australian Electoral Data

This is a simple notebook with the two-party-preferred outcomes from Australian elections from 1972 to 2019. These scores are based on the ratio of seats won by the major parties (the Australian Labor Party and the LNP Coalition, consisting of the Liberal, National, Country Liberal, and Liberal National parties).

The final dataset compiled by the notebook can be found in [export.csv](export.csv).
